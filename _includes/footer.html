                      <p>Your data helps us to understand your needs and helps to provide you with a better service. We may occasionally send out emails concerning new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting using the email address which you have provided. CB Digital Group Ltd will not disclose any of your information to any third parties except in a situation where it is part of providing a service to you. This includes arranging for a product to be sent to you, carrying out security checks and for the purposes of customer research or when you have given us permission to do so.</p>
                      
                      <h2 class="pages">Payment</h2>
                      
                      <p>If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then PayPal stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.</p>
                      
                      <p>All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover.</p>
                      
                      <p>PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.</p>
                      
                      <h2 class="pages">THIRD PARTY SERVICES</h2>

                      <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>

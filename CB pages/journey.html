		         <p>We were one of a leading companies to provide satellite for both TVRO (Television Receive Only) and Data Services. 
		In 1985 we cherish the idea of making a new concept that was not acceptable apart from early adopters. As a company that prides ourselves on good service we knew that our company would go from strength to strength.</p>
		
		<p>Our products included SMATV (Satellite Master Antenna Television) for hotels, fixed dishes for single channel, motorised dishes for multi-site applications.</p>
		
				<p>In 1990 our mobile network sections of the company included car installations and voice recognition. We needed to be a leading edge company, so in 1995 we took the plunge in plasma TVs and were impressed with their flatness and reduce weight. This was a major breaking point in technology and our customers were fully impressed.
		The plasma screen provided something that the market had never seen, and was different from what has come before.</p>

		      <p>As our reputation grew we had to show our worth and in 1998 we provided audio-visual, TVRO and automation for the home and office. CB Digital knew that this was a big step forward and knew the future was bright. We then took on yachts that were over 100' feet long. This was uncommon to see a boat of this magnitude in those days. We were contracted to take on the AV, that included surround sound, plasma TVs with TVRO and data satellite.</p>

					<p>In 2000 something had caught our imagination, it was the Internet! The World Wide Web provided endless possibilities and had many benefits to our lives and would be the forefront of what we do, say and work.</p>
			  		<p>As this grew we have ventured in to cloud Technology to serve many parts of the business, that include web hosting, email and critical backup.</p>

		    <p>It was realised that clients demanded a more bespoke service that integrated audio, visual and communications into their homes, and from this need we lead the way to providing a discrete, simple to use solution that gives outstanding service.</p>
		
			<p>From this long term experience we can guide you through the process of planning and choosing the right system, and minimise any headaches associated with the technical aspect of a job.</p>
		
			<p>Whilst dealing in both domestic and commercial markets we can provide a high level of service and work closely with architects, consulting engineers, designers and builders from concept to completion stage.</p>
		
			<p>What makes us different? We are fully committed on all levels of technology. We endeavour to commit to our strengths and know that our clients are our number one priority.</p>
